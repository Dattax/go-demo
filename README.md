## Course Description

When you’re new to an industry, you encounter a lot of new concepts. This can make it really difficult to get your feet underneath you on an unfamiliar landscape, especially for junior engineers. What does DevOps really mean? What’s all this software? What’s all this jargon? Is DevOps a methodology, or a toolset? Is any of this actually going to make my life easier, or is it just a bunch of industry buzzwords? I’ll answer all of these questions (and more) during this hands-on workshop, and get you set up with an end-to-end DevOps solution to automate your build artifact storage, vulnerability detection, testing, and deployment. For profit and glory!
